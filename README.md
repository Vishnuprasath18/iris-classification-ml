# Iris Flower Species Prediction

This machine learning project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library and includes a Jupyter notebook (`iris_classification.ipynb`) that guides through the data exploration, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers. The dataset is included in the scikit-learn library.

## Usage

To run the project locally, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
